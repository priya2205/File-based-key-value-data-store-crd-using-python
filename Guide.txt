I have created basic CRD operations and
two more method to change the value of key and to extend time to live time.
I used class and objects to implement this problem
You can import the library as "import dataStore as ds"
 a json file will be created you can create and manipulate data by the methods provided in the library
If you run operations operations wait for few seconds to get output because I have
implemented time.sleep() method for few seconds to show the functionality of time-to-live  property
I have implemented Lock to make the program thread-safe.
This program works well with windows os.
A guide to the library

 syntax-> datastore.create(key,vallue,timetolive)
 it takes 2 to 3 parameters if timetolive is not given then it is initialised to zero
 key - the name of key , it should be capped at 32 chars
 value - value of key, it should be capped at 16kb
 timetolive - time -to-live time in seconds
 syntax-> dataStore.read(key)
 key -key to be read 
 syntax-> dataStore.delete(key)
 key -key to be deleted
 modifyValue(key,value)
 key - key, which value has to change
 value - new value of key, it should be capped at 16kb
 syntax->extendTimeToLive(key,time)
 key - key,which timetolive has to extend
 timetolive - amount of time -to-live time to be extended in seconds
